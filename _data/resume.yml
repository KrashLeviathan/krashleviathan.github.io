        - "I've had a long and strange journey to arrive at the place I am today, but I wouldn't change it for the
           world! I think my unique background has made me well-rounded and gives me additional insight into the
           different challenges I encounter. Having been a lifeguard, valet attendant, professional musician, window
           washer, US Marine, HVAC technician, and now Software Engineer, I do well at adapting to most situations."
        - "Most of my experience so far has been in full stack web development, but I love learning new technologies
           and applying myself in different areas. One of the things I love about software development is the ability
           to create something tangible that can benefit and delight users. My primary passion in my younger days was
           creating music, but now I get to pour my energies into creating software! I believe in continual
           reinvention of self and striving to learn more, do more, and achieve more every day."
