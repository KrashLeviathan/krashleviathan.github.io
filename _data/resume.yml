    profile:
        - "I've had a long and strange journey to arrive at the place I am today, but I wouldn't change it for the
           world! I think my unique background has made me well-rounded and gives me additional insight into the
           different challenges I encounter. Having been a lifeguard, valet attendant, professional musician, window
           washer, US Marine, HVAC technician, and now Software Engineer, I do well at adapting to most situations."
        - "Currently I work as an Application Developer at Zirous, an IT consulting company in West Des Moines, IA.
           I have experience designing, developing, and testing software solutions to meet strategic business goals.
           My affinity for learning and mastering new technologies allows me to bring valuable insights to conceptual
           planning and discussions, enabling the team to choose the right tools needed to deliver high quality results.
           My effective written and verbal communication skills help keep development efforts aligned with customer
           expectations, ensuring the right solution is delivered the first time and reducing wasteful rework. As a
           consultant, I excel at identifying pain points in development processes and presenting thoughtful solutions
           to maximize efficiency and increase return on investment. My recent work focus has been in the application
           of data science and machine learning techniques to build intelligent systems."
        - "One of the things I love about software development is the ability
           to create something tangible that can benefit and delight users. My primary passion in my younger days was
           creating music, but now I get to pour my energies into creating software! I believe in continual
           reinvention of self and in striving to learn more, do more, and achieve more every day."
