**Live Site:** [https://krashleviathan.github.io/](https://krashleviathan.github.io/)

This portfolio site was made for ComS 494 at Iowa State University.
The site theme is based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) template
[jekyllDecent](https://github.com/jwillmer/jekyllDecent). Eventually this site
will replace the current [KrashDev.com](http://krashdev.com/).
