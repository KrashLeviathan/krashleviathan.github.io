I remember hearing about the Volkswagen emissions scandal in 2015 and thinking back
to the years I lived in California. I had grown up in the Midwest, where mandated
emissions testing was not a thing. After moving to California in 2009, it was an
annoyance that had to be undergone every 2 years for each vehicle you owned. The
likelihood of a modern vehicle failing the tests seems minimal, but the possibility
was still enough to make me a little nervous since I wasn't used to the requirement.

"Why wouldn't a modern vehicle pass?" I'd ask myself, hoping to take some comfort in
the fact that everything was routine. Emissions standards were nothing new. Many of
the agencies governing emissions were established in the 60's, so surely a car
manufactured 40+ years later would pass any emissions tests. Granted, the emissions
requirements get more and more strict as the years pass, but car manufacturers are
not so dull as to ignore such an important requirement.

You can imagine, then, my shock that a company would blatantly disregard such
standards, lie to the public, and market a vehicle that cheated to pass the tests!
*A scandal of this magnitude only happens on cable television shows, right?* It
was dumbfounding. Of course, the press savored every juicy morsel of such a
delicious scandal. The legal and financial repercussions for the company were
equally staggering. Everyone was left wondering, "How could this have happened?"

[Darden Professor Luann Lynch and Carlos Santos (2011) examined that same question.](https://ideas.darden.virginia.edu/2016/10/vw-emissions-and-the-3-factors-that-drive-ethical-breakdown/){:target="_blank"} 
They arrived at three primary factors that drive ethical breakdown in an organization:
pressure, opportunity, and rationalization. The engineers were under enormous pressure
from higher up the organizational ladder to deliver on such a difficult goal. The
opportunity to cheat was present, because the software to detect emissions testing
was already developed. Finally, they may have rationalized the decision to cheat
under the pretense that the potential penalty would be trivial in proportion to the
gains to be made from cheating the system.

It's hard to say 100% definitively "if I were in the shoes of those engineers, I *never*
would have done that!" because I wasn't there and I don't know the entire context
surrounding the situation. However, I am fairly certain that if faced with a similar
dilemma, I would have the courage to raise the red flag. It would start at the lowest
level—the internal engineering team—and proceed higher if the concerns
were brushed off. That's how it works in the military. If you have an issue, you
handle it at the lowest level, but if that doesn't work, you start raising the issue
higher and higher up the chain of command. In the civilian world, if your team supervisor
won't listen, you talk to a higher manager. If you get to the CEO and he won't listen,
you talk to a regulatory agency about the matter. Whistle-blower protection laws are in
place to ensure there is no workplace retaliation (i.e. getting fired because you reported
malpractice), so you can never go wrong with this approach.

It's hard to say why the Volkswagen engineers made the decisions they did. We can see that the
rationalization could have been made from a financial aspect due to what was perceived as a trivial
penalty fine, but that doesn't explain the moral decision. Fear of repercussions for not
accomplishing the goal likely played a part in it. It could also be that the engineers scoffed
the strict emissions restrictions in the US, believing the restrictions were overreaching and
unnecessary. Whatever the case, they failed to take into effect the full legal ramifications
and public relations fallout that would ensue. They also made the decision out of the company's
best interest and not in the best interest of the public, and steps taken in that direction can
lead to morally questionable grounds.
