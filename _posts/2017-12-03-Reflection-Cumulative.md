## First, a Word of Thanks

I have been tremendously blessed to have been able to attend college in
pursuit of my dreams; and not once, but twice! Consider these various facts,
and see if any of it makes sense. During my time at Iowa State...

1. My wife and I had 2 kids within 14 months of each other.
2. We bought a house.
3. I founded and (briefly) ran a <a href="https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/site/web-dev-club" target="_blank">club</a>
   on campus.
4. Ashlee and I started a small business from scratch.
5. Aside from paid summer internships, I didn't really have to work during my
   time at school.

Wait... what? *How is that possible!?* Our friends and family would often
look at our situation and think, "How are they *paying* for all of this?"
Like I said, we have been tremendously blessed. God has had his loving hand over
our lives and has provided in every way imaginable.

The GI Bill benefits from serving
in the Marine Corps were a large part of that blessing, so thank you everyone
for paying your taxes and supporting our armed forces! I used to laugh at
those who joined the military just for the college benefits, but now that I've
been at the receiving end of those benefits, I can honestly say that they are
well worth enlisting for! Of course, it probably shouldn't be your *primary*
reason for enlisting, but... well, I'll just leave it at that.

Scholarships and grants from the government, from ISU, and from generous donors
also played a big part in funding my education and my family's well-being. God
blessed me with the ability to do well in school, and it didn't take long before
I saw a direct correlation between grades and funding. This brought the realization
that *doing well in my classes was more important than holding a part-time job*.
Thus, the decision to refrain from work was made. By focusing my time entirely
to my studies (as well as family), I could be a better provider financially to my
family in the short term, with scholarships, and in the long term, with better
job placement upon graduation.

Last, but not least, I need to thank my family and friends for their emotional,
financial, and spiritual support through everything. My and my wife's parents
have been tremendously supportive, and their gifts also played a large part in
providing for our family these past four years. Within our first **year** (singular) in Ames,
Ashlee and I moved *three times* (good grief!), and there was always a crowd of
friends and family willing to help us do what nobody likes to help do! The
prayers, emotional support, and encouragement also helped us say afloat during
rough patches and difficult times. *So thank you everyone! You made us feel 
wonderfully loved!*

I wanted to start this reflection on a note of thanks, because it really is
by God's grace that we made it to where we are today. Any glance back over
such a tumultuous time of growth requires you to take stock of what you have
to be thankful for. If we lose sight of that, we lose a little bit of what it
means to be human. Knowing that your success is not your own is humbling, and
it allows you to show compassion and grace to those who are less fortunate than you.

## Preparing Professionals

The goal of any engineering program is to train and equip students to become
professionals. Professional problem solvers in a given domain. We're trained
in the entire life cycle of project development, from conception to completion, and we're
given enough hands-on experience to solidify conceptual understanding and to
develop good habits, reliable instincts, and a systematic approach.

As with many learning experiences in life, you get out of it what you put into
it. Students in the Software Engineering program get the chance to do project
work and put their skills into practice every semester. Some students choose
to do the bare minimum, and I imagine they don't get as deep an understanding
of their field as those that choose the hard problems, take chances, and
stretch themselves.

This hands-on project work is where we get to take the classroom experience
and apply it to a real system. In that respect, I feel that Iowa State does a
good job at preparing students to design systems and processes. Here's a quick
rundown of *some* of the various project experience I've had over the past four
years:

All of these experiences forced us to make thoughtful design decisions and formulate
solutions to engineering problems. Of course, we weren't just thrown these problems
and expected to sink or swim on our own. The material taught in the classes prepared
us, giving us the tools needed to tackle each new problem.

Some of the harder things for a university to teach in an engineering program
are global/societal issues and ethical implications. At ISU, and I imagine at most
universities, these things are given a brief shout-out in several of the classes,
but they're not covered in any great detail. Since the course load is full enough
as it is, I can't imagine where they would fit some required class that discussed
these in depth. However, I will say that the multi-cultural nature of universities, the
international perspective and US diversity requirements, and the obligatory
discussions in some of the professionalism classes do well enough to prepare students
with at least a basic understanding of global, societal, and ethical engineering issues.

### Team Work and Interpersonal Communication

I mentioned that we do lots of hands-on experience in the Software Engineering
program, but it's also important to note that many of those projects are
done in teams (often groups of four). This helps students to develop their
communication, project management, and collaboration skills. Working in groups
forces you to encounter issues outside the domain of technical engineering
problems. What do you do when a fellow team member isn't pulling his weight?
How do you react when the team wants to take a shortcut instead of delivering
quality work? How do you communicate your views, opinions, and arguments
tactfully and persuasively, without antagonizing the other team members?
Working as a team also helps give fresh perspective on problems that you would
not have thought of otherwise.

## Learning to Learn Quickly

I saw a great programming humor t-shirt that read as follows:

> WHAT I SAY:
> I'm a software develo-
>
> WHAT PEOPLE HEAR:
> I can repair your computer, fix your internet, configure your printer,
> revive your phone, set up your email, build a billion-dollar app, and
> hack into any system. All for free. I am the IT god.
>
> WHAT I MEAN:
> I can Google better than the average bear.

Joking aside, it's true that we do a lot of Googling as programmers! And not just
from lack of experience or forgetfulness. Choosing a career in software development
means keeping pace with the times, and technology changes at a ridiculously fast
rate. The framework of today is a dinosaur in only a few short years. At Iowa State,
I've worked in Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, Php, Dart, HTML, CSS, MySQL, Perl,
Angular, Angular2, ANTLR, Verilog, Matlab, Solidworks, Bash, Assembly, Java Spring,
and on and on and on. Languages, libraries, frameworks, development tools, IDEs,
operating systems, and all the other technologies that you deal with are just a
part of life as a developer. *You have to become good at learning, and learning
quickly!* And of all the different technologies I've learned in the past four years,
only a small handful of them were actually formally taught in a class. Most of the
learning is on your own time. Self taught and on the job, so to speak.

Here's an example: For our senior design project, we chose a project that would
need to be implemented in Node.js. Though I had used JavaScript before, I had never
worked on a Node project. In addition to learning the ins and outs of the language,
it required extensive research into each dependency we chose to use. For example,
we needed an HTTP client module to make requests to various REST endpoints. For
Node, there's several popular ones to choose from: Axios, Got, Request, Reqwest,
and Superagent, to name a few. Each decision of this type forced us to evaluate
different options, choose the best one, and then *learn* the usage and syntax
for that given dependency. The moral of the story: in the world of software
development, you're never done learning!

Some learning pursuits that happen outside of coursework have nothing to do with
your studies. Sometimes it's just to satisfy an itch. To explore something new
and exciting that intrigues you. Hackathons
(e.g. <a href="http://hackisu.org/" target="_blank">HackISU</a>) are great outlets
for creativity and learning new things. I attended four of these during the first
couple years at ISU. One thing I'm looking forward to doing during the upcoming
Christmas break is taking an online course at Udemy.com covering
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/penetration-testing/" target="_blank">penetration
testing</a>. It's not something that was taught in any of my courses, but it's
something that fascinates me!

## Finishing My Degree

At the time of writing this post, I am two weeks away from finishing my second-to-last
semester at Iowa State. I think there is very little I would change about my
experience. Even the class I dropped taught me life lessons that I wouldn't
have gotten otherwise. With projects, however, whenever I look back at old
projects I have the tendency to say, "Ah! If only I knew then what I know now, what
a difference that would have made! I could have made it so much better!" But I
guess that in itself is evidence of growth. Being able to look back at your work
with pride but without ever being fully satisfied... that means that you are
continuing on an upward trajectory towards better mastery of your craft.&nbsp;&#9632;
