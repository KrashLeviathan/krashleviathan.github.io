The greater share of my "general education" experience comes not
from the classroom, but from having changed direction many times
in my life. That's the beauty of living in America: if you don't
like where you're at, you have the power to do something about it!
"Work hard, apply yourself, and anything is possible," we like to
tell our children. In my case, it turned out to be true! I spent
the first few years after high school pursuing a music career.
When that dried up, I decided to enlist in the Marine Corps
infantry. (Talk about a change in direction!) After five years
active duty I started my engineering degree at Iowa State
University. Even then, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I
started as a Mechanical Engineering major, but after a year of
studies, I realized my calling was not in Mechanical but in
Software Engineering.

What does this have to do with General Education electives? Well,
while my path through life has been an adventure, I wouldn't
exactly call it the clearest road map to success. At the time I
finally graduate, I will be 31 years old. Most developers my
age in the workforce have been working in software development
for almost a decade, rising up the ladder in responsibility and
pay rate. They likely have their college debt paid off and have
started saving for retirement. I, on the other hand, will be
starting fresh at 31 with over $90k in student loans (mine and
my wife's). So while I cherish the unique life experiences that
have given me a great deal of perspective on the world, I know
there's a much more efficient route to get where I am today.

That's where GenEds come in. Just as my unorthodox journey made
me well-rounded and gave me perspective, so too do general
education courses. They're designed to make you versatile,
giving you a foundational understanding of the world as well as
a broader perspective that can help shed light and wisdom on
the challenges you face in your personal or professional life.
Our primary task as engineers is to think critically about problems
to arrive at an appropriate solution. As it turns out, critical
thinking cannot take place in a vacuum. If all we had to guide us
was our technical knowledge, we would come up with very clever
ideas that either miss the mark entirely or fall short of their
true potential.

Think about the concept of Design Thinking. Design Thinking begins
with Empathy, described by Knct Lab (2015) as follows:

> Any social endeavor begins with the human element. It involves
> identifying the molecules that make up your target audience,
> getting under their skin and finding out what they value, what
> they want and how they look at the world. The challenge of the
> designer lies in synthesizing this within the context of their
> design.
>
> <cite>—[The 5 steps of Design Thinking](http://www.knctlab.com/blog/5-steps-design-thinking){:target="_blank"}</cite>

To empathize with our users, we need to be able to view the world through
their eyes. You need perspective. This is the sort of thing that general
education electives offer. In my Design Cultures class (DSN S 183),
we talked a lot about this
design thinking process and how it is applied to "wicked" problems.
The [Austin Center for Design](http://www.ac4d.com/) (2012) defines a wicked
problem as...

> ...a social or cultural problem that is difficult
> or impossible to solve for as many as four reasons: incomplete or
> contradictory knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved,
> the large economic burden, and the interconnected nature of these
> problems with other problems.
>
> <cite>—[Wicked Problems: Problems Worth Solving](https://www.wickedproblems.com/1_wicked_problems.php){:target="_blank"}</cite>

As you can see, this way of design thinking about problem solving has
a strong correlation to the kind of problem solving that engineers
are faced with. The Design Cultures course itself falls outside the
engineering curriculum, but the perspective it offers can be directly
applied to the way we engineers think about problems.

While I chose Design Cultures specifically for its close ties to
engineering, I have experienced other similar benefits from classes
I did not expect to. For example, in the second semester of my sophomore
year I took Introduction to American Government (POL S 215) out of a
desire to better understand government and politics to be able to play
a more informed role in our country's democratic system. This I accomplished,
but the added bonus I did not expect to gain was a better understanding
of engineering problems in the political domain. Problems surrounding
electronic voting, political polling, social media influence graphing,
etc. And while the course didn't explicitly cover these topics, when I
encountered them later in my Software Engineering curriculum, I had a
greater understanding of the different factors at play and what the
impact of those factors were.

Another couple other classes that broadened my perspective were Principles
of Microeconomics (ECON 101) and Literature for Children (HD FS 240).
The economics class is recommended to freshmen by the advisors and
has a more obvious impact on our trade as engineers (supply and demand,
opportunity cost, etc.), but Literature for Children was, again, one
that I took for my own reasons and came away from with more than
I bargained for.

      <img src="{{ "/assets/reading_to_the_boys.jpg#right" | absolute_url }}" />
	  <figcaption>I love reading to my two boys!</figcaption>
   </figure>
</aside>

I originally took Literature for Children for two reasons: First, I have
two boys of my own (ages 1 and 2) whom I love reading to, so I figured
a children's literature class would only help in that area. The other
reason was to fulfill the US Diversity requirement set forth by the
College of Engineering. I wasn't especially excited to learn the diversity
element, but it turned out to be very engaging. Growing up in small-town
Iowa, it was easy to overlook the issue of social inequality in our country.
Not that I was oblivious to the fact, but it was never an evident issue
in my own community, so I wasn't directly impacted by it and didn't think
about it. However, engineering is a very multi-national, diverse field,
and you find yourself often working with people from all walks of life.
Having taken a course that focuses some of its efforts on diversity,
it has made me more sensitive to the topic when approaching an
engineering problem and working towards a solution.

Thinking back on my experiences before Iowa State—pursuing a career in
music and serving in the Marine Corps—it's easy to see the manner in which
the experiences shaped my perspective of the world. They have become part
of my identity. However, I am also grateful for the way my general
education experience at Iowa State has helped prepare me for the
challenges to come. We students take GenEds begrudgingly at times, but
their ultimate impact is to make us more effective members of society.


## What's next for me?

Before graduation in May of 2018, I have a few major short-term goals,
the most immediate of which is the launching of my wife's start-up
business, [Lilia Grace](http://www.lilia-grace.com/){:target="_blank"},
on November 13th. I've been helping setup the various online technologies,
including the website, online store, ShipStation, MailChimp, etc. We're
excited to see the response at launch, but it really is quite a lot of
work to start a business! My other short-term goals are to finish my
remaining time at Iowa State honorably and to ready our house for sale
in the spring. I say "honorably" because once the pressure of finding a
job is over, the temptation to slack starts to creep in. It's not in my
nature to submit shoddy work, though, so I just need to dig in and work
hard to finish out my remaining time at Iowa State.

In the long term, I'm looking forward to starting work at
[Zirous](https://www.zirous.com/){:target="_blank"} in the spring.
Zirous is an information technology and consulting company, and I'll
be working as an application developer on one of their teams. I'm
really excited about it! One of the things I like about working for
a consulting company is that I'll get to work on many projects, with
lots of different technologies, across a wide range of industries. I'd
like to learn as much as I can at Zirous and maybe someday start my
own business.
