<h2 style="text-align:center;">The difficulties of sharing,<br>and how books can help</h2>

If you’ve had kids, you’ve heard it before. “No, that’s mine!” You look across the room and watch the
argument unfold as one toddler desperately tries to recover what was believed to be his or her rightful
property. Panic, anger, and frustration combine in an overwhelming flood of emotions. The beleaguered
child may cry, scream, stomp about, or resort to more forceful means of reappropriation. You wonder to
yourself, “Who is this kid, and what has he done with my son? I know I didn’t teach him that!”

Fear not! The emotions and behaviors your child displays are very normal to development. According to
educators at the University of Pittsburgh Office of Child Development ("You & Your Child: Sharing," n.d.),
it’s usually time to start teaching your child about sharing around the age of two. In their handout,
they have some really good suggestions, such as ways to teach and demonstrate the concept of sharing,
creating opportunities for your child to practice sharing, and providing reinforcement or punishment
in connection with a desired or undesired behavior.


### Where do books come in?

Children’s books can be an effective tool to help your child work through the difficult emotions that
arise when first learning how to share. This type of therapy falls under the broader discipline known
as bibliotherapy. The American Library Association (2017) defines bibliotherapy as follows: “The use of
selected reading materials as therapeutic adjuvants in medicine and psychiatry; also guidance in the
solution of personal problems through directed reading.”  What this means for us as parents is that
we can help our children grow and develop by selecting quality books to help deal with the issue of
sharing in a thoughtful and creative manner. Young children love having books read to them, so what
better way to engage them and discuss the topic in a positive way than with a book?


### Suggestions for using books to talk to your child about sharing

Bibliotherapy begins with researching the topic (Google is your best friend), making book selections,
and setting aside time to read and discuss the material with your child. Dr. Thomas McIntyre (2014),
a professor at Hunter College of CUNY, says that this act of analysis and discussion can help the
child “unblock emotions and relieve emotional pressures.” (citation) If your child is old enough,
it can help to plan a creative activity to stimulate thought about the topic. This could be through
drawing, writing, blogging, vlogging, acting out situations, or singing songs. Find something
appropriate to your child’s age level that would keep him or her engaged.

The counselors at TreeHouse Counseling (2015) offer the following additional tips, with an emphasis
on using bibliotherapy with older children:

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Even older kids can use a good picture book. They are quick to read, provide interesting illustration,
      and an older kid can see details that a younger child does not discern.  Don’t rule out the picture book.</li>
    <li>If your child doesn’t like to read, consider the graphic novel. Graphic novels require a child to take
      in so much detail from the pictures, make inferences, and use deductive reasoning. There are many well
      written graphic novels to use as bibliotherapy.</li>
    <li>Consider reading chapter books with your teens.  Discussion promotes comprehension, identification, and
      generalization.</li>
    <li>You can ask a librarian or a counselor for a relevant title when challenged with a particular topic.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

        <p>This book is about a beautiful fish with colorful, shiny scales who finds himself an outcast because
            of the way he treats the other fish, refusing to play or share with them. After seeking advice from
            a wise, old octopus, he learns the value of inclusion and friendship as he shares his scales with
            the other fish. The book features dazzling foil material for the scales, which gives it instant

        should behave instead. The irascible and yet charming personalities of the dinosaurs really
        come to life in the hilarious illustrations that feature massive dinosaurs in an otherwise

        <p>The main character in the story doesn’t want to share his “house” (a cardboard box) with any

        for people with glasses.” He changes his mind at the end when he is excluded from the fun
        because he has red hair, upon which he sees that the house belongs not to him but to everyone.
        In addition to talking about sharing, the book offers the opportunity to talk to your kids
        about discrimination.</p>
