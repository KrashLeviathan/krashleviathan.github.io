This project explored creating a command line interface that runs in the browser,
combining two types of interfaces into a unique user experience. The application
was written in Dart, a language developed by Google that transpiles to JavaScript
to run in the browser.

The hardest part of the project was, of course, trying to replicate a bash command
line with process management. For it to be useful to users at all, it needed to
provide core functionality that users expect from a command line. Scope creep
started to slow down development momentum, so eventually I had to nail down what
features I wanted in release v1.0.0 and settle for additional features in later
releases. The desired functionality for the first release was as follows:

- Interactive IO
- Process management
- Environment variable storage, recall, and persistence
- Command completion (via the tab key)
- Input history (accessible with the up and down keys)
- A set of standard library processes

The set of standard library processes in v1.0.0 includes:

<dl>
    <dt>authentication</dt>
    <dd>loads user/session information from the document cookies and (in later
        versions) will authenticate the userâ€™s credentials.</dd>
    <dt>echo</dt>
    <dd>prints the supplied input back to the shell.</dd>
    <dt>export</dt>
    <dd>creates a variable that persists across browser sessions via cookies.</dd>
    <dt>help</dt>
    <dd>offers help information for the command line interface.</dd>
    <dt>jobs</dt>
    <dd>lists all processes that are currently running.</dd>
    <dt>printenv</dt>
    <dd>prints all environment variables.</dd>
    <dt>testinput</dt>
    <dd>demonstrates how to get user input from within a process and how to call
        other commands from within a process.</dd>
    <dt>unset</dt>
    <dd>erases an environment variable.</dd>
</dl>
