This program interfaces with the NextBus REST API to display NextBus information for
CyRide in Ames. It can return bus route information in a variety of formats, based on
user input of route, stop, etc. Users are also able to configure the program so that
they can quickly find out the time of the next bus heading home or the time of the next
bus heading to school/work without having to manually type all the optional parameters.
The program is meant to be usable with other bus agencies (not just CyRide), but my
target for release was CyRide, so no other agencies were tested extensively during
development.

The program, which was written in C++, curls the NextBus information with an http
request, which returns the data in XML format. A custom XML parser was written to pull
out relevant information to display to the user. XML data that can be reasonably cached
and referenced later is saved in the directory “$HOME/.nextbus/” along with a configuration
file with user-specific settings.

The most practical usage of the program is the saved route and stop feature. When you're
working late into the night on a project and you're ready to go home, just type
`nextbus home` and get bus arrival estimations without ever having to open the browser
or pull out a phone!

Another application of nextbus I am currently exploring is the use of the program with
an LED seven-segment display integrated with a Raspberry Pi. I added the `-m | --minutes`
command line parameter to allow the program to only output the minutes remaining until the
next bus leaves for a given stop. The program is then executed every 30 seconds from a
python script running on the Pi, and the output is fed into the LED display. The proof
of concept is operational — my next step is to move the logic to a Raspberry Pi Zero (a
model the size of a credit card), design an enclosure in Solidworks, 3D print the enclosure,
and mount it on my wall for daily use!
